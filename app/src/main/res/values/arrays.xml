    <item>Cereal Guy is a stick figure character commonly used on image boards and discussion forums as a multi-purpose reaction face.</item>
    <item>F!@# Yeah is a series of four-pane cartoon strips featuring a stick figure looking rather self-complacent and quite frankly, for all the right reasons. Originally posted via /b/ board on February 11, 2010, these cartoons illustrate all sorts of triumphant moments in our daily lives that make us feel awesome, like when you wake up a few seconds before the morning alarm goes off. This phenomenon can be also seen as the antithesis to Rageguy comics, another four-pane series originating from 4chan circa late 2008.</item>
